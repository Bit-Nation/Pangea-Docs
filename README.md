## Community Resources

If you want to contribute to the growth of the Bitnation community and our mission - this is the place for you.

The best place to get to know the community is to join our [Discord channel](https://discordapp.com/invite/whzS4Fr) or our [Telegram channel](https://t.me/PangeaBitnation) and start contributing. It's helpful to write a short introduction about yourself and what you're interested in doing. Please keep in mind that these are public spaces which anyone can join, which means anyone can read your conversation, hence do not say anything that might put you at risk legally or security wise in any of the public channels. Our Slack channel is still used, but we can't accept anymore people into it, due to the Slack restrictions. 

The Slack, Discord and Telegram communities will be moved to Pangea in 2019, when the desktop client launches.

### Join the Ambassador and Embassy Networks

The Ambassador and Embassy networks were conceived as analogue versions of Pangea. A real world network of people and places where digital nomads can get advice, peer-to-peer assistance, meet-up and hang out. There are three types of Bitnation representatives:
 -  Diplomatic Ambassadors: Official Bitnation positions to perform duties as Officers working as our interface with existing Nations, as well as new virtual Nations. 
 -  Diplomatic Consuls: Also an Official position. A support to both our Ambassadors and to Nation State embassies and consulates engaging with our Citizens in the location of our Embassies and Consulates. 
 -  Goodwill Ambassadors: Informal but officially recognised representative of Bitnation during events (such as DEVCONs). Promotes and supports Bitnation and our services and provides a point of contact for our Citizens. 

Embassies and Consulates are where share their space, whether it’s an office, coffee shop or your home, and open it up for fellow citizens, hackers and crypto aficionados around the world! There are two types of places, Embassies and Consulates.
 -  Embassy  A place where you can both live, and work (and naturally, meet).
 -  Consulate A place where you can work – like a shared office space or cafe, for instance – or maybe organise a meetup or a hangout.

Bitnation has over 100 embassies, consulates worldwide. You can find out more about the [Ambassador Network](https://tse.bitnation.co/ambassador-registration/). **All these functions will soon be moved from the website to the Pangea software.**


### Start Your Own Nation

The Pangea software is setup for you to create your own Decentralized Borderless Voluntary Nation (DBVN). You can set it up directly on the Android and iOS app, with a small amount of ETH gas. Here are a few resources read up on before you setup your own Nation:

 -  This [Questionnaire](https://github.com/Bit-Nation/Pangea-Docs/blob/master/create-your-own-nation.pdf) to help you plan your Nation.
 -  Our [DBVN Resource Center](https://bitnation.co/nations-resources/?la=en).
 -  Some [Advice](https://steemit.com/blockchain/@bitnation/create-your-own-nation-by-tarkowski-tempelhof)... 

### Submit a Local or Global Governance Project Idea

You can [submit an idea](https://bitnation.consider.it/?tab=Show%20all) for a local or global governance project on our website, and vote and discuss pros and cons of others people's proposal. Keep in mind that you're likely to get more feedback if your proposal has clear and specific goals, timelines, expected outcomes and measurable deliverables.

Some of the proposals might be funded by Bitnation as DApps or Incubated Nation ideas.

### Help with Documentation, Translation and Educational Resources 

Good documentation is key for an Open Source Software movement. 
 -  Help documenting best practices, key events, processes etc.
 -  Translate materials like Whitepapers, community updates, articles, videos. 
 -  Create manuals, videos and blog posts to help explain how to be part of the community and how to use the software. 

### Help Grow our Community through Outreach and Engagement

There are many ways to help grow the movement through outreach and communication. Here's a list of a few activites that are really impactful.
 -  Organize Online Google Hangouts and Local Meetups.
 -  Produce content, like YouTube videos, software demo videos, graphic materials, blog post etc.
 -  Help newcomers on Telegram to understand BITNATION and find their way around the app and our resources (like this one here).
 -  Help people outside of our community to understand more about BITNATION, the Pangea software, cryptocurrencies, decentralized technologies, the importance of privacy and security and everything else beautiful in the world :smile:.

### Community Code of Conduct

The generic [Citizen Code of Conduct](http://citizencodeofconduct.org/) is [applied](https://github.com/Bit-Nation/Pangea-Docs/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to most repositories and channels within BITNATION. However, here are some values we would like to highlight more specifically. 

 -  **Clarity above all** Understanding the challenges of communicating across different timezones, culture and personalities both during written and verbal communications. It’s advisable to avoid sweeping statements in favor of clearly articulated sentences with well defined purposes. 
 -  **Refrain from jumping to conclusions** A fundamental problem in many conversations is that we overestimate others capacity to understand our written and verbal communications, and we overestimate our own capacity to understand what they’re trying to communicate. When analyzing what the other person is trying to communicate, take their context into account, including things like timezone, native language, and personal circumstances. 
 -  **Respectfulness** We have come together to change the status quo through creating kickass software, to that end being disrespectful can divert the conversation from our set purpose into irrelevant areas. Personal slights and attacks does not foster a good collaborative space, it's wise to avoid them. When we are emotionally affected by communications, attempt to take a step backwards and swallow the chill pill.

## Development Resources

### Getting Started

We use PivotalTracker for project management. It is essentially a Scrum board similar to Trello. It allows us to have better transparency as a team regarding what the status of our work is, and what our near-term roadmap is. It's a new tool for most of us, so we're still getting the hang of best practices. As of 12/7/2018, our [primary board](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/2204148) and our [architecture board](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/2213396) is open to the public, in the interest of transparency and collaboration.

The best way to get involved in the development process is through joining [Gitter](https://gitter.im/pangea-dev/Lobby) after reading the following documentation. You can also get an invitation to the core development team on Slack through speaking with the admins on our Telegram or Gitter chat. 

If your aim is to develop a custom governance DApp or Bot on Pangea, please start with reading this [DApp Engine](https://github.com/Bit-Nation/pangea-developer-documentation/blob/master/docs/_completed_docs_v1.md) documentation.
