## Community Resources

If you want to contribute to the growth of the Bitnation community and our mission - this is the place for you.

The best place to get to know the community is to join our [Slack](https://bitn.slack.com) channel and start contributing.
It's helpful to write a short introduction about yourself and what you're interested in doing. Keep in mind that the Slack chat is *not* encrypted, and it's open for anyone to join, hence don't share anything you think could compromise your security, and use a pseudonym if you want to remain anoymous. 

Popular channels you can join includes #_dev`, `#_marketing`, `#townhall`, `#intros`, and `#watercooler`.

### Join the Ambassador and Embassy Networks

The Ambassador and Embassy networks were conceived as analogue versions of Pangea. A real world network of people and places where digital nomads can get advice, peer-to-peer assistance, meet-up and hang out. There are three types of Bitnation representatives:
 -  Diplomatic Ambassadors: Official Bitnation positions to perform duties as Officers working as our interface with existing Nations, as well as new virtual Nations. 
 -  Diplomatic Consuls: Also an Official position. A support to both our Ambassadors and to Nation State embassies and consulates engaging with our Citizens in the location of our Embassies and Consulates. 
 -  Goodwill Ambassadors: Informal but officially recognised representative of Bitnation during events (such as DEVCONs). Promotes and supports Bitnation and our services and provides a point of contact for our Citizens. 

Embassies and Consulates are where share their space, whether it’s an office, coffee shop or your home, and open it up for fellow citizens, hackers and crypto aficionados around the world! There are two types of places, Embassies and Consulates.
 -  Embassy  A place where you can both live, and work (and naturally, meet).
 -  Consulate A place where you can work – like a shared office space or cafe, for instance – or maybe organise a meetup or a hangout.

Bitnation has over 100 embassies, consulates worldwide. You can find out more about the [Ambassador Network](https://bitnation.co/ambassador-network/) or [Register as an Embassy](https://bitnation.co/embassy-consulate-directory/) on our website. **All these functions will soon be moved from the website to the Pangea software.**


### Start Your Own Nation

The Pangea software is setup for you to create your own Decentralized Borderless Voluntary Nation (DBVN). However, until Pangea v.03 is out you can do it yourself through using our DBVN code. Here are a few resources to help you setup your own Nation:

 -  The [BITNATION Framework](https://github.com/Bit-Nation/BITNATION-Framework).
 -  The [old DBVN code](https://github.com/Bit-Nation/BITNATION-Constitution/tree/master/dapp).
 -  This [Questionnaire](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bitnationfiles/create-your-own-nation.pdf) to help you plan your Nation.
 -  Our [DBVN Resource Center](https://bitnation.co/nations-resources/?la=en).
 -  Some [Advice](https://steemit.com/blockchain/@bitnation/create-your-own-nation-by-tarkowski-tempelhof)... 

### Submit a Local or Global Governance Project Idea

You can [submit an idea](https://bitnation.consider.it/?tab=Show%20all) for a local or global governance project on our website, and vote and discuss pros and cons of others people's proposal. Keep in mind that you're likely to get more feedback if your proposal have clear and specific goals, timelines, expected outcomes and measurable deliverables.

For now the Project page is mostly for discussing ideas, but after the ICO we'll be able to fund some of them through Smart Contracts. 

### Help with Documentation, Translation and Educational Resources 

Good documentation is key for an Open Source Software movement. 
 -  Help documenting best practices, key events, processes etc.
 -  Translate materials like Whitepapers, community updates, articles, videos. We're setting up [this resource](https://crowdin.com/project/bitnation-documentation) to help collaborate on translations.
 -  Create manuals, videos and blog posts to help explain how to be part of the community and how to use the software. 

### Help Grow our Community through Outreach and Engagement

There are many ways to help grow the movement through outreach and communication. Here's a list of a few activites that are really impactful.
 -  Organize Online Google Hangouts and Local Meetups.
 -  Produce content, like YouTube videos, software demo videos, graphic materials, blog post etc.
 -  Help new commers on Slack to understand BITNATION and find their way around Slack channels and other resources (like this one here).
 -  Help people outside of our community to understand more about BITNATION, the Pangea software, cryptocurrencies, decentralized technologies, the importance of privacy and security and everything else beautiful in the world :smile:.

### Community Code of Conduct

 -  **Clarity above all** Understanding the challenges of communicating across different timezones, culture and personalities both during written and verbal communications. It’s advisable to avoid sweeping statements in favor of clearly articulated sentences with well defined purposes. 
 -  **Refrain from jumping to conclusions** A fundamental problem in many conversations is that we overestimate others capacity to understand our written and verbal communications, and we overestimate our own capacity to understand what they’re trying to communicate. When analyzing what the other person is trying to communicate, take their context into account, including things like timezone, native language, and personal circumstances. 
 -  **Respectfulness** We have come together to change the status quo through creating kickass software, to that end being disrespectful can divert the conversation from our set purpose into irrelevant areas. Personal slights and attacks does not foster a good collaborative space, it's wise to avoid them. When we are emotionally affected by communications, attempt to take a step backwards and swallow the chill pill.

 -  The previous version of [Pangea](https://github.com/Bit-Nation/BITNATION-Pangea) can be tested via `npm` thanks to `npm run test` (please install the dependencies with `npm install` first). 
 -  [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/Bit-Nation) is used per default in key-repositories
 -  [Panthalassa](https://github.com/Bit-Nation/BITNATION-Panthalassa) support the golang testing framework, use `go test -v ./...` in the cloned project (after downloading dependencies).
 -  The [entity framework](https://github.com/Bit-Nation/BITNATION-Framework) uses truffle, everything is bundled via `npm` after installing dependencies via `npm install` just do `npm run test`.
 -  The informations concerning the registry are detailed in its [readme](https://github.com/Bit-Nation/BITNATION-Registry/blob/master/README.md).

### Code Commit Guidelines and Code of Conduct

 -  Some repositories includes issue or pull request templates, use them whenever possible.
 -  Make your commit messages clear, and try to follow the same pattern than the one used in the target repo.
 -  Please avoid duplicating any issue or pull request, **any duplicate will be closed**.
 -  Split your different changes in a clear way via commits, it will make the reviewer's task easier.
 -  Only one major change should be submitted per pull requests, help us review your code faster!
 -  Last but not least: be respectfull, no abuses will be ever tolerated and could result to the close of your issue/pull request without further notice.
